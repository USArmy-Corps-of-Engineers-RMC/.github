Welcome to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Risk Management Center (RMC) organization. This GitHub site hosts the RMC risk analysis software suite and other supporting open source projects. 

***

The RMC is responsible for leading the development of risk-related tools and risk methodology for the USACE Dam and Levee Safety programs and supports risk approaches in other related areas as directed by USACE Headquarters. 

The RMC has developed a robust suite of risk analysis software to support dam and levee safety investment decisions. The tools allow engineers to generate quality flood hazard, potential failure mode, and consequence information, and compute risk analysis results. The tools can interact together as a suite or independently as standalone software. The analysis methods contained within each tool are cost-effective and scalable so practitioners can achieve higher quality results from more advanced study using all the same tools. Many of these tools were recently released on the [RMC website](https://www.rmc.usace.army.mil).
